## üíª Requirements

Thes Windows App SDK samples have the following system requirements:

- Windows 10, version 1809 (build 17763) or later.

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or Visual Studio 2019 version 16.9 or later, with the following workloads and components:

    - Windows application development
    - .NET Desktop Development (needed even if you're only building C++ Win32 apps)
    - Desktop development with C++ (needed even if you're only building .NET apps)
    - Windows SDK version 2004 (build 19041) or later. This is installed with Visual Studio by default.

Refer to the docs on [system requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/system-requirements) and [tools for Windows app development](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment) for a detalied list of requirements for developing apps with the Windows App SDK.

## üöÄ Using the samples

To use the samples with Git, clone the WindowsAppSDK-Samples repository by running `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples.git` from a command prompt. You can then navigate to the directory of a sample and open the solution file in Visual Studio.

The easiest way to use these samples without Git is to download the ZIP file. Select *Download ZIP* from the download dropdown, unzip the entire archive and open the samples in Visual Studio.

## üìÑ Samples versioning

The samples will be updated with GA releases of the Windows App SDK. The `main` branch includes the latest samples, which may also include experimental or preview features. Specific release branches are named `release/x.y` and contain samples that reference the corresponding GA version of the Windows App SDK. This repository currently includes the following release branches:

- [release/experimental](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/release/experimental)
- [release/1.6](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/release/1.6-stable)
- [release/1.5](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/release/1.5-stable)
- [release/1.1](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/release/1.1)
- [release/1.0](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/release/1.0)

## üèÜ Contributing

These samples are provided by feature teams and we welcome your input on issues and suggestions for new samples. We encourage you to [file a new issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/issues/new) for any feedback or questions!

Sample authors should follow the [samples guidelines](docs/samples-guidelines.md) to begin developing their samples. For WinUI-based Windows App SDK samples, use the [sample templates](Templates/README.md). The VSIX file is available for download in the GitHub releases page [here](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/releases).

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information, see the Code of Conduct FAQ or contact opencode@microsoft.com with any additional questions or comments.

Once a new sample app has been added, Microsoft developers shall consider updating the internal Aggregator pipeline to:
- Enable building of the new sample app regularly.
- Add a new test case to the existing SampleTests TAEF test driver to regularly verify successful launchng of the sample app against the latest Windows App SDK version.

Refer to the documentation on the internal Aggregator repository for instructions, in the BuildSampleApps and TestSampleApps Stages.
