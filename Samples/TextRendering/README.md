# DWriteCore gallery sample

This sample application demonstrates the DWriteCore API, which is a reimplementation of the Windows DirectWrite API. Select items from the *Scenario* menu to see pages that demonstrate various API functionality.

DWriteCore is a low-level API for formatting and rendering text. It's a nano-COM API, meaning that it uses COM-style interfaces (derived from **IUnknown**), but it doesn't actually use the COM run-time. It's therefore not necessary to call **CoCreateInstance** before using DWriteCore. Instead, call the **DWriteCreateFactory** function to create a factory object (**IDWriteFactory7**), and then call factory methods to create other objects or perform other actions.

## API Layers

The **text layout API** is the highest layer of the DWriteCore API. It includes *text format* objects (**IDWriteTextFormat4**),
which encapsulate formatting properties, and *text layout* objects (**IDWriteTextLayout4**), which represent formatted text
strings. A text layout object exposes methods for drawing, getting metrics, hit-testing, and so on. Paragraphs displayed within
the running sample app are text layout objects.

The **font API** exposes information about fonts and provides functionality needed for text layout and rendering. It includes
*font collection* objects (**IDWriteFontCollection3**), which are collections of fonts grouped into families, *font set* objects
(**IDWriteFontSet3**), which are flat collections of fonts, and *font face* objects (**IDWriteFontFace6**), which represent specific
fonts.

The **text rendering API** provides interfaces uses for rendering text. When you call a text layout object's **Draw** method,
it calls back to an interface (**IDWriteTextRenderer1**), which must be implemented by the application or by some other library.
The use of an abstract callback interface enables DWriteCore to be decoupled from any particular graphics engine. The text
renderer implementation can use text rendering APIs provided by DWriteCore to help with rendering glyphs. The **TextRenderer**
class in this application provides a sample implementation of the **IDWriteTextRenderer1** interface.

The **text analysis API** provides low-level APIs for sophisticated applications that implement their own text layout engines.
This includes script analysis, bi-directional analysis, shaping, and so on.

## Prerequisites

* See [System requirements for Windows app development](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/system-requirements).
* Make sure that your development environment is set up correctly&mdash;see [Install tools for developing apps for Windows 10 and Windows 11](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment).

## Building and running the sample

* Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
* Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

    > Note: When building the solution, if you get an error related to a PowerShell command: </br></br>`The command "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -file ..." exited with code 1.` </br></br> You will need to manually run that PowerShell command to build. Copy the full PowerShell command inside the quotes of the error message and paste it into a command prompt.
* Set "DWriteCoreGallery (packaging)" as the startup project. Right click "DWriteCoreGallery (packaging)" and select "set as startup project" from the context menu.
* For debugging, it is recommended you change the debugger type for the "DWriteCoreGallery (packaging)" project to "Native Only".
In the project properties, select the "Debug" tab, and set the Debugger type for both "Application process" and "Background
task process" to "Native Only".
