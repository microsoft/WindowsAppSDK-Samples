# Load resources using MRT Core

MRT Core is the modern resource loading library used in WinUI 3 and the Windows App SDK. These samples demonstrate how to use MRT Core to load resources from multiple resource files and how to select which version of a specific named resource to load.

**Note**: The unpackaged sample apps reference an [experimental version](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/experimental-channel) of the Windows App SDK. Unpackaged app deployment is not currently supported for use by apps in production environments.

## Building and running any of the samples

Before building the sample, make sure to set up your environment correctly by following the steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment).
For the unpackaged sample apps, in addition to the steps for setting up the environment for the Windows App SDK, make sure to follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/deploy-unpackaged-apps).

1. Open the solution file (.sln) in the subfolder of your preferred sample in Visual Studio 2019 Preview.
