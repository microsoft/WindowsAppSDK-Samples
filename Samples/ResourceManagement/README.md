# Load resources using MRT Core

MRT Core is the modern resource loading library used in WinUI 3 and the Windows App SDK. These samples demonstrate how to use MRT Core to load resources from multiple resource files and how to select which version of a specific named resource to load.

## Prerequisites

* See [System requirements for Windows app development](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/system-requirements).
* Make sure that your development environment is set up correctly&mdash;see [Install tools for developing apps for Windows 10 and Windows 11](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment).
    * For the unpackaged sample apps, make sure to also install the prerequisites for [deploying unpackaged apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/deploy-unpackaged-apps).

## Building and running any of the samples

* Open the solution file (`.sln`) from the subfolder of your preferred sample in Visual Studio.
* From Visual Studio, either **Start Without Debugging** (Ctrl+F5) or **Start Debugging** (F5).
