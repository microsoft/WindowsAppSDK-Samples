## WpfWithIslandApp

This app demonstrates how to add a WinAppSDK island to a WPF app.

The WPF app was converted to an MSIX packaged app.  The **AppPackaging.wapproj** project accomplishes this.  [More info here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-packaging-dot-net).

Look for the token `Changed_from_original_app` to see what changes were made to the project file to pull in **WindowsAppSDK**.
