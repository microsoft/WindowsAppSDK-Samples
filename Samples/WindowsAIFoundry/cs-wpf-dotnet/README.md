## Prerequisites
- For system requirements, see [System requirements for Windows app development](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/system-requirements).
- To ensure your development environment is set up correctly, see [Install tools for developing apps for Windows 10 and Windows 11](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment).
- Running this sample does require a [Windows Copilot+ PC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/ai/npu-devices/)
- Running this sample also requires that the [Windows App SDK 1.8 Experimental2](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/downloads#windows-app-sdk-18-experimental) framework package is installed on your Copilot+ PC.
- This sample requires .NET and .NET CLI [Install .NET on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows)

### Suggested Environment

Use "Developer Command Prompt for VS2022" as your command prompt environment

## Build and Run the sample
In the command line, cd to the root of the solution and run
```
runDotNetBuild.cmd or runDotNetBuild.ps1
```

runDotNetBuild.ps1 will generate the MSIX with a self-signed cert which you will need to install to
LocalMachine TrustedPeople Certificate Store.

It will then run dotnet build on 

## Sample Overview

The `MainWindow` class in `MainWindow.xaml.cs` is the main user interface for the Windows AI APIs Sample application. It demonstrates how to use the Windows AI APIs to perform text recognition and summarization on an image. The key functionalities include:

- **Select File**: Allows the user to select an image file from their file system and displays the selected image in a PictureBox.
- **Process Image**: Processes the selected image to extract text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and then summarizes the extracted text.

### Key Methods and Event Handlers

- **SelectFile_Click**: Opens a file dialog for the user to select an image file and displays the selected image.
- **ProcessButton_Click**: Handles the processing of the selected image, including loading AI models, performing text recognition, and summarizing the text.
- **LoadAIModels**: Loads the necessary AI models (`TextRecognizer` and `LanguageModel`) for text recognition and summarization.
- **PerformTextRecognition**: Uses the `TextRecognizer` to perform OCR on the selected image and extracts the text.
- **SummarizeImageText**: Uses the `LanguageModel` to generate a summary of the extracted text given a prompt.

### WAPProj Conversion to SingleProjectMSIX

Because .NET CLI is incompatible with WAPProj, we must first convert the WAPProj to a
SingleProjectMSIX This project was converted from a WAPProj to SingleProjectMSIX using the steps
below https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/single-project-msix?tabs=csharp

For the original WindowsAISampleForWPF project with wapproj, please see:
Samples\WindowsAIFoundry\cs-wpf

Summary of the steps done:
- Add EnableMsixTooling and PublishProfile properties to WindowsAISampleForWPF.csproj
    ```
    <EnableMsixTooling>true</EnableMsixTooling>
    <PublishProfile>Properties\PublishProfiles\win10-$(Platform).pubxml</PublishProfile>
    <GenerateAppxPackageOnBuild>true</GenerateAppxPackageOnBuild>
    ```

- Add WindowsAISampleForWPF\Properties\launchSettings.json
  This configures on how an application starts during development
  
- Add /Properties/PublishProfiles/win10-$(platform).pubxml 
  This defines the publishing configuration for each platform is necessary for each platform you
  want to publish and deploy on. 

- Move Package.appxmanifest and files under images from the WAPProj to WindowsAISampleForWPF.csproj and remove
  the WAPProj.

- In configuration manager, check the deploy box in each of the configuration/platform you want to
  deploy on
