# Composition Samples
Welcome to the Windows Composition Samples. These samples demonstrate the usage of both Microsoft.UI.Composition and Windows.UI.Composition APIs that you can use to enhance your Windows App SDK application.

This is the place for the latest code samples, demos, and developer feedback around building beautiful and engaging WinUI3 apps. This repo focuses on the platform building blocks that make up the [Fluent Design System](https://fluent.microsoft.com/), with emphasis on creating UI using APIs in the [Microsoft.UI.Composition](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.composition) and [Microsoft.UI.Input](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.input) namespaces. For those of you familiar with the Universal Windows Platform Composition Samples, these samples are very similar but instead built on the APIs in the WinAppSDK (to learn more about the WinAppSDK, visit [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/)).
